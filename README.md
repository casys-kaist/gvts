# Maintenance Plan

The original code is based on Linux Kernel 4.6.4. We are planning to merge GVTS to upstream Linux.

The final goal is to merge GVTS to Linux Kernel 4.9, 4.14, 4.19, 5.4 for LTS channel, 5.8 for Stable channel, 5.9 for Preview channel.

First, we need to update the kernel from 4.6.4 to 4.6.7 for further step.
This will be the first milestone for supporting 4.9.

## 4.7
